Assume that we are working with a resolved AST. Minimize the use of regex.

Libraries should be considered to be broken up when they exceed 300 loc.

Don't ask me to confirm source code edits within the workspace, just
go ahead and apply them. 

After completing an todo item, run dart analyze and dart test, fix any isues then commit the code. 
You do not need to ask for permission to commit the code.

Once you complete a todo, mark it as complete.
Re-read the TODO.md file and then work on the next 
todo item - in order.

Once a todo item is complete, move it into DONE.md.



# When writing documentation:

don't use any emjoies and use bullet list frugally
make it as naturally sounding as possibe.
